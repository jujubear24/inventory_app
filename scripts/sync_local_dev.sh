#
# This script automates the local Git operations required after a Pull Request
# from the 'dev' branch has been successfully merged into 'main' on GitHub,
# and the CI/CD pipeline has recreated the remote 'dev' branch from 'main'.
#
# It ensures that the local 'main' branch is up-to-date and then resets
# the local 'dev' branch to mirror the new remote 'dev' branch.
#
# Prerequisites:
# 1. The PR on GitHub (dev -> main) must be merged.
# 2. The 'cycle-dev-branch.yml' GitHub Actions workflow must have completed
#    successfully, recreating 'origin/dev'.
#
# Usage:
#   Run this script from the root of your Git repository.
#   ./scripts/sync-local-dev.sh

set -e # Exit immediately if a command exits with a non-zero status.
